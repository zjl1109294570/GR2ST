# GR2ST: Spatial Transcriptomics Prediction based on Graph-Enhanced Multimodal Contrastive Learning

## Overview
GR2ST leverages a large pre-trained pathology model to extract high-level histological features. We designed a dual-branch graph architecture, consisting of a dynamic threshold-based functional graph and a radius-constrained spatial graph, to capture complex spot interactions within heterogeneous tissues. The model aligns histology images with gene expression representations through a multimodal contrastive learning framework. It achieves adaptive gene expression generation via a Cell-Type Guided Multi-Branch Regression Head supervised by a context-aware weighting network, which is further integrated with cross-sample retrieval to construct an ensemble prediction. The performance of the model is evaluated on three cancer-related spatial transcriptomics datasets, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and two human breast cancer cohorts, to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness.

## GR2ST pipeline

- Run `hvg_her2st.py` generation of highly variable genes.
- Run `data_precessing.ipynb` to obtain the various data required for model training.
- Run `train_her2st.ipynb` to train the model on the her2st dataset using leave-one-out cross-validation.
- Run `evel_her2st.py` to calculate the PCC between predicted and ground truth gene expression to evaluate model performance.
